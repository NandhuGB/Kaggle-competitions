# 🏆 Kaggle Competitions Repository

Welcome to my Kaggle Competitions repository! This repository showcases my participation in various Kaggle competitions, highlighting the approaches, models, and techniques I used to tackle real-world data science and machine learning problems.

<!-- ## 📁 Directory Structure

Each directory corresponds to a specific competition and contains:

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.
- `datasets/`: Data files (preprocessed or sampled). **Note**: Full datasets are not included to comply with Kaggle's competition rules.
- `models/`: Trained models or serialized pipelines.
- `src/`: Python scripts for custom utility functions, feature engineering, or model pipelines.
- `README.md`: Detailed information about the competition, the dataset, and my approach.
